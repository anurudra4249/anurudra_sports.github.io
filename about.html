    <p>Health is God’s gift to us. Health refers to the physical and mental state of a human being. To stay healthy is not an
    option but a necessity to live a happy life. The basic laws of good health are related to the food we eat, the amount of
    physical exercise we do, our cleanliness, rest, and relaxation. A healthy person is normally more confident,
    self-assured, sociable, and energetic. A healthy person views things calmly, and without prejudice. <br>
    
    
    
    Introduction Health is God’s gift to us. Health refers to the physical and mental state of a human being. To stay healthy is not an
    option but a necessity to live a happy life. The basic laws of good health are related to the food we eat, the amount of
    physical exercise we do, our cleanliness, rest, and relaxation. A healthy person is normally more confident,
    self-assured, sociable, and energetic. A healthy person views things calmly, and without prejudice. <br>
    
    
    
    Introduction <br>
    “The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, answered "Man! Because he sacrifices his health to
    make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does
    not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never
    going to die, and then dies having never really lived.” This signifies that individuals don’t prioritise their mental
    health to earn money. Some even work 24 hours a day or seven days a week. <br>
    
    However, you have the option to remain balanced. So, balance work and fitness daily. Always strive to keep a cheerful as
    well as a concentrated routine. It is necessary to plan ahead of time. In any case, one must maintain a good mental,
    bodily, and emotional state, and no professional or counsellor can assist you unless you desire to live. The will to
    live in the moment and make the most of it awakens the ideal strength within you, and you are the only one who can never
    let yourself fall apart. <br>
    
    
    
    Importance of Maintaining Health <br>
    We live in a super-fast age. The Internet has shrunk the world dramatically and people are connected 24x7. Multitasking
    is the order of the day, as we struggle to fulfill our responsibilities for everyone in life. In this fight, we often
    forget to spare time for ourselves. The stress levels continue to build up until one day a major collapse may make us
    realize that in all this hectic activity, we have forgotten to take care of one important thing – our health. <br>
    
    As we spend days shuttling between hospital and home, putting our body through one test after another, trying to find
    out what has gone wrong, we are forced to remember that ‘Health is indeed Wealth’. <br>
    
    In earlier days, life was very simple. People worked for a stipulated time, often walked everywhere, ate more homemade
    food, did household chores, and enjoyed a healthy balance in life. <br>
    
    Now people have cars and bikes to commute, so they walk less. With the demand for more working hours, people are awake
    till late at night and indulge in more junk food than home-cooked food. Modern equipment at home has reduced the labour
    work and increased dependency on this equipment. People don’t have enough time to exercise or even get enough sunlight.
    Nowadays people are living very unhealthy lifestyles. <br>
    
    Unhealthy living conditions have increased the contraction of people to various diseases like obesity, diabetes, heart
    attacks, hypertension, etc. This has alarming implications in the near future. So it is very important to focus on our
    health as much as we focus on our work. Moderation in food habits, daily exercise, and balanced work-life can surely
    make a big difference to our health and body. When a person stays mentally and physically fit, his actions and decisions
    are more practical and logical and hence he is more successful in life. Furthermore, good health has a direct impact on
    our personality. <br>
    
    It's crucial to consider how much self-control you have to keep a healthy lifestyle. Research reveals that changing
    one's behaviour and daily patterns are quite tough. According to the data, whether a person has a habit of smoking,
    drinking alcohol, doing drugs, or any other substance, it is extremely difficult to quit. A study found that 80% of
    smokers who tried to quit failed, with only 46% succeeding. <br>
