    <p>Cricket is a very famous game played by many people around the world and the most loved game in India. It is an outdoor
    game. Cricket is played with a bat and a ball on a field with a rectangle pitch in the centre. Two teams play, and each
    team gets to bat and bowl. There are 11 players on each of these teams. There are wickets placed at the ends of the
    pitch. <br>
    
    The two batsmen must try to score a good score while the bowling team tries to bowl them out. One team sets a score
    which the other team must beat. If they beat the score, they win. An umpire makes sure they follow the rules. A bowler
    can bowl six balls in one over. The game can be played in 3 formats â€“ T20, ODI and test matches. Cricket is played in
    many countries like England, Australia, India, South Africa, etc. The ICC makes the rules for the game. <br>
    
    Children and adults love cricket. Children love to play this game on the streets or in empty grounds and have a lot of
    fun while playing it. Many people watch matches on TV or in the stadiums and cheer loudly for their team.
